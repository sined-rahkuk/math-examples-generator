# Program

Program allows the user to generate math examples that are yet to be solved. Its output is as follows:

1. File **приклади.txt** contains unsolved generated examples

2. File **відповіді.txt** consists of the same examples *but with correspond answers* to check match sister's results (kinda lazy I know).

## Usage

`python example.py [-h] [-a] [-f] [-s]`

Whereas:

  `-h` or `--help` option shows you how to use the program

  `-a` or `--amount` option specifies the amount of examples to be generated

  `-f` or `--first` option allows you to specify the [rank](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C "how many digits are in number") of the first number

  `-s` or `--second` option allows you to specify the [rank](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C "how many digits are in number") of the second number

## Requirements

In order to use the program you've got to have Python 3.

## Notes

In-program documentation is written in my native language - Ukrainian. That's because I would like my parents who aren't that good in English to be able to use it as well. Refer to ***Usage*** section for English version.
